                <h2>My Hackbright Project</h2>
                <p>I chose to work on this project because I am a big fan of Spotify's app and I love live music. I wanted to create an app that you could tell your favorite artist and it would branch out through Spotify's related artists relationships and find upcoming concerts you might like in your city. One of the biggest challenges I faced while making this was speed. Searches hit both the Spotify and Songkick (for event data) APIs and took 20 seconds. After many different attempts at solving this problem, I came across the grequests library and used asynchronous requests to reduce search speed to about 4 seconds.</p>

                <h2>Thistle Internship</h2>
                <p>I was an intern at <a href="https://www.thistle.co/">Thistle</a>, a healthy food and juice delivery company based in Berkeley. The project I worked on as an intern was to integrate Thistle's CRM (Intercom) with Twilio. The idea for the integration came about because customer service had to switch between two systems in order to respond to customers. Some customers were chatting with them online via Intercom and others were texting into a Google voice number for support. This meant customer service reps had to switch between the two interfaces and also that communication for each customer was being saved on two systems. With the Twilio Intercom integration, all customer conversations will be managed within Intercom.</p>

                <h2>Guiltless</h2>
                <p>Guiltless is a project I worked on for the Expat Women's Hackathon on September 10, 2016. I worked on this project with six other women (total of five engineers and one designer). I am very proud of what we put together in only a day. The Hackathon theme was "SF City Hack Challenges" and we chose to work on a project to encourage SF residents, new expats and tourists support local businesses. Our project essentially aimed to help people choose an outing (mainly food and drink) that they could walk to. The app allows people to narrow down the choices of what/where to eat and also to find a place that is a 1-2 mile walk away. We called this 'Guiltless' because you could feel good about going out because you walked to and from your tasty dinner/dessert/cocktail. Not to mention, San Francisco is a beautiful, walkable city.</p>
                <p>For this project I mainly worked on the back end. I helped build the search to find things sufficiently far away (rather than closest to you). I also worked on the geolocation feature. Code for this project can be found <a href="https://github.com/lyoness1/feel-less-guilty">here</a>. Overall, this was a great experience. It was so much fun to work with a team of people who enjoy programming as much as I do.</p>

                <h2>Bleepie</h2>
                <p>Bleepie is a current work in progress. With this app, users can create a pet which will become sick and die if the user drinks too much alcohol. Version 1.0 of the app will ask users for a Blood Alcohol Level (BAL) at a certain time daily using the Twilio API for SMS. A certain BAL level will make your pet sick and a very high level will kill your bleepie pet. The design for the Bleepie creature was (rather inexplicably) inspired by a shallot. Bleepie is too cute - don't let it die! Users will receive points for keeping their pet alive for more days.</p>
                <p>The concept for this project came from my brother, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/andyhrunyon/">Andy Runyon</a>. He also did all of the art for the project (he's looking for work as a 3D animator if you're hiring!). I wanted to work on this because I love the idea. I also thought it would be a good opportunity to become more familiar with Django. Code for the project can be found <a href="https://github.com/DoriRunyon/meepo">here</a>.</p>
